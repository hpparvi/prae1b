Hi everyone,

I have been asked to help organize confirmation, followup, and analysis of the potential transit discovered in the Praesepe cluster, EPIC 211916756.  We will need a shorthand - I propose Prae-1, unless anyone has a more sensible recommendation.  Here is the information we have about it for now.
